DATA VIZUALIZATION USING PYTHON (Jupyter Notebook)

In this project, I have used the COVID-19 cases and its impact around the world

- The dataset comprises of 31 columns and 18232 rows
- Data types used are int, float and object 
- Categorical variables are Location and Age
- Date Timeline variables are used
- Dataset has less than 3% missing values and have either been removed or imputed with means/most frequently occurring values

Note: The data here is sourced from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), who provide these statistics only
